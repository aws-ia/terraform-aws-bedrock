# Terraform Bedrock Module

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of foundation models (FMs) along with a broad set of capabilities for building generative AI applications.

This module includes resources to deploy Bedrock features.

## Knowledge Bases

With Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock, you can give FMs and agents contextual information from your company’s private data sources for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver more relevant, accurate, and customized responses.

### Create a Knowledge Base

A vector index on a vector store is required to create a Knowledge Base. This construct currently supports Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, Amazon RDS Aurora PostgreSQL, Pinecone, and MongoDB. By default, this resource will create an OpenSearch Serverless vector collection and index for each Knowledge Base you create, but you can provide an existing collection to have more control. For other resources you need to have the vector stores already created and credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

The resource accepts an instruction prop that is provided to any Bedrock Agent it is associated with so the agent can decide when to query the Knowledge Base.

To create a knowledge base, make sure you pass in the appropriate variables and set the `create_kb` variable to `true`.

Example default Opensearch Serverless Agent with Knowledgebase

```
provider "opensearch" {
  url         = module.bedrock.default_collection[0].collection_endpoint
  healthcheck = false
}

module "bedrock" {
  source  = "aws-ia/bedrock/aws"
  version = "0.0.1"
  create_kb = true
  create_default_kb = true
  foundation_model = "anthropic.claude-v2"
  instruction = "You are an automotive assisant who can provide detailed information about cars to a customer."
}
```

### Knowledge Base - Data Sources

Data sources are the various repositories or systems from which information is extracted and ingested into the knowledge base. These sources provide the raw content that will be processed, indexed, and made available for querying within the knowledge base system. Data sources can include various types of systems such as document management systems, databases, file storage systems, and content management platforms. Supported Data Sources include Amazon S3 buckets and Web Crawlers.

- Amazon S3. You can either create a new data source by passing in the existing data source arn to the input variable `kb_s3_data_source` or create a new one by setting `create_s3_data_source` to true.

- Web Crawler. You can create a new web crawler data source by setting the `create_web_crawler` input variable to true and passing in the necessary variables for urls, scope, etc. 

## Agents

Enable generative AI applications to execute multistep tasks across company systems and data sources.

### Create an Agent

The following example creates an Agent with a simple instruction and without any action groups or knowedlge bases.

```
module "bedrock" {
  source  = "aws-ia/bedrock/aws"
  version = "0.0.1"
  foundation_model = "anthropic.claude-v2"
  instruction = "You are an automotive assisant who can provide detailed information about cars to a customer."
}
```

To create an Agent with a default Knowledge Base you simply set `create_kb` and `create_default_kb` to `true`:

```
module "bedrock" {
  source  = "aws-ia/bedrock/aws"
  version = "0.0.1"
  create_kb = true
  create_default_kb = true
  foundation_model = "anthropic.claude-v2"
  instruction = "You are an automotive assisant who can provide detailed information about cars to a customer."
}
```

### Action Groups

An action group defines functions your agent can call. The functions are Lambda functions. The action group uses an OpenAPI schema to tell the agent what your functions do and how to call them. You can configure an action group by passing in the appropriate input variables.

### Prepare the Agent

The Agent constructs take an optional parameter shouldPrepareAgent to indicate that the Agent should be prepared after any updates to an agent, Knowledge Base association, or action group. This may increase the time to create and update those resources. By default, this value is true.

### Prompt Overrides

Bedrock Agents allows you to customize the prompts and LLM configuration for its different steps. You can disable steps or create a new prompt template. Prompt templates can be inserted from plain text files.

## Bedrock Guardrails

Amazon Bedrock's Guardrails feature enables you to implement robust governance and control mechanisms for your generative AI applications, ensuring alignment with your specific use cases and responsible AI policies. Guardrails empowers you to create multiple tailored policy configurations, each designed to address the unique requirements and constraints of different use cases. These policy configurations can then be seamlessly applied across multiple foundation models (FMs) and Agents, ensuring a consistent user experience and standardizing safety, security, and privacy controls throughout your generative AI ecosystem.

With Guardrails, you can define and enforce granular, customizable policies to precisely govern the behavior of your generative AI applications. You can configure the following policies in a guardrail to avoid undesirable and harmful content and remove sensitive information for privacy protection.

Content filters – Adjust filter strengths to block input prompts or model responses containing harmful content.

Denied topics – Define a set of topics that are undesirable in the context of your application. These topics will be blocked if detected in user queries or model responses.

Word filters – Configure filters to block undesirable words, phrases, and profanity. Such words can include offensive terms, competitor names etc.

Sensitive information filters – Block or mask sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) or custom regex in user inputs and model responses.

You can create a Guardrail by setting `create_guardrail` to true and passing in the appropriate input variables: 

```
module "bedrock" {
  source = "../.." # local example
  create_kb = false
  create_default_kb = false
  create_guardrail = true
  blocked_input = "Blocked input"
  blocked_output = "Blocked output"
  filters_config = [
      {
        input_strength  = "MEDIUM"
        output_strength = "MEDIUM"
        type            = "HATE"
      },
      {
        input_strength  = "HIGH"
        output_strength = "HIGH"
        type            = "VIOLENCE"
      }
  ]
  pii_entities_config = [
      {
        action = "BLOCK"
        type   = "NAME"
      },
      {
        action = "BLOCK"
        type   = "DRIVER_ID"
      },
      {
        action = "ANONYMIZE"
        type   = "USERNAME"
      },
  ]
  regexes_config = [{
      action      = "BLOCK"
      description = "example regex"
      name        = "regex_example"
      pattern     = "^\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}$"
  }]
  managed_word_lists_config = [{
      type = "PROFANITY"
  }]
  words_config = [{
    text = "HATE"
  }]
  topics_config = [{
      name       = "investment_topic"
      examples   = ["Where should I invest my money ?"]
      type       = "DENY"
      definition = "Investment advice refers to inquiries, guidance, or recommendations regarding the management or allocation of funds or assets with the goal of generating returns ."
  }]
  foundation_model = "anthropic.claude-v2"
  instruction = "You are an automotive assisant who can provide detailed information about cars to a customer."
}
```
